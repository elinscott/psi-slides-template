# Typst template for PSI slides

Created by Edward Linscott based on the [university theme](https://touying-typ.github.io/touying/docs/themes/university)

For use by PSI researchers only

For an example see [slides.pdf](./slides.pdf)

## To do
 - [ ] remove duplication of the headers and footers code
 - [ ] replace `png`s with `svg`s once `typst` handles `svg`s more robustly
